# CAF Design System

CAF's design system, built on **GDL** (the General Design Library), the same
way the CAF Figma library subscribes to the GDL Figma library.

```
@vdm-design-team/caf
├─ tokens/core/color.json         CAF's own ramps: caf-blue, caf-blue-on-dark
├─ tokens/core/typography.json    font.family.sans → Inter (CAF's one override of GDL)
├─ tokens/semantic/color*.json    the 312 semantic colours, Light + Dark
└─ dist/                          theme.css, tokens.css, tokens.dark.css, …
                                  = GDL's tokens + CAF's, in GDL's output format

from @vdm-design-team/gdl (never copied here)
   palette (slate, green, red, …), spacing, radius, stroke, fonts,
   elevation 1–7, the 47-style type ramp, dark elevation, desktop sizes,
   the semantic colour contract, the build formats, gdl-check-contract
```

What comes from where, and why: [`docs/inheritance.md`](docs/inheritance.md).

## Using it in a CAF app

```css
/* in place of @import "tailwindcss" */
@import "@vdm-design-team/caf/theme.css";
```

Utilities follow the token names: `bg-surface-canvas`, `text-text-primary`,
`bg-action-primary-surface-default`, `border-stroke-default`,
`text-body-md-regular`, `rounded-8`, `shadow-elevation-3`, `bg-caf-blue-500`.
Dark theme: put `.dark` on `<html>`.

The package is published to GitHub Packages (`.npmrc`:
`@vdm-design-team:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`, plus a token with
`read:packages`).

## Working on CAF

```bash
npm install            # pulls GDL from its git tag — no token needed
npm test               # lint tokens, build, GDL contract, contrast (strict), changelog entry
npm run import:figma   # after refreshing figma-export/ — see docs/figma-sync.md
```

- Tokens are generated from the CAF Figma library — never hand-edit `tokens/`.
- Anything GDL has stays in GDL. `lint:tokens` fails on a copied GDL colour
  family or an override that isn't on its allow-list.
- Every PR touching `tokens/`, the build config or the GDL version adds a
  `changes/<branch>.md` entry (see [`changes/README.md`](changes/README.md)).
- Rules for people and AI agents: [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## Upgrading GDL

A GDL release is CAF's "Library updates available". Bump it in its own PR:

```bash
npm install --save-dev "github:VDM-Design-Team/GDL-design-system#semver:^0.2.0"
npm run import:figma && npm test
```

Read GDL's `CHANGELOG.md` for the versions in between. A `major` GDL release
lists what CAF must change under `Migration:`.

## Releasing

```bash
npm run changelog      # fold changes/ into CHANGELOG.md and bump the version
```

Merge that as the release PR, then create a GitHub release tagged
`v<version>`. The release workflow publishes `@vdm-design-team/caf`.

## Status (v0.1)

- Tokens only. Components come next, built straight from the CAF Figma
  library onto these tokens (shared ones move up into GDL once a second
  brand needs them).
- Every semantic pair meets WCAG AA in Light and Dark: text and labels
  4.5:1, the focus ring and component borders 3:1. `npm test` runs
  `check:contrast --strict`, so a new failure fails CI. Fix it in Figma.
- No `stroke.field` or `surface.track` yet. GDL recommends both.

## Figma

- CAF Design Library: `WhVkTrQRI9bDTfOeAJXTrR` (components only).
- CAF Design file (screens): `z7L8r4nq6nL6Yfa8vvxJhO`.
- Parent: GDL `1rBM831Vs5ZS4OsRwIPH52`.
